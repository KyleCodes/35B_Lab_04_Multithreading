# 35B_Lab_04_Multithreading
In iteration #4, I've added multithreading features to enable multiple users to access information at the same time, without corrupting the database. This is accomplished by creating synchronized methods within the model package that manage the modification of attributes within a single Automobile object. It is tested by having two threads access the same auto.
